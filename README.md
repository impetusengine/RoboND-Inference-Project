# RoboND-Inference-Project

Two exercises are implemented on Nvidia's DIGITS deep learning GPU training system. First, object classification is performed on a neural network trained on images of candy boxes and bottles photographed on a conveyor belt. This network is called P1 modlel. Second, a comparison is made between a neural network trained on images of numerically distinguished groups of three dimensional objects called RealModel and a neural network trained on images of numerically distinguished groups of two dimensional shapes called FlatModel. This pair of networks are tested on a testing set called RealTest which contains images of groups of three dimensional objects and a testing set called FlatTest which contains images of groups of two dimensional irregular shapes to investigate each network's accuracy in classifying the number of objects or shapes in an image. Realization of accurate classification for numerical abstraction is achieved on RealModel which successfully recognized number in both testing sets: RealTest and FlatTest. On the other hand, FlatModel failed to classify members of RealTest but succeeded to classify images of FlatTest. 

P1Model, RealModel, and FlatModel are folders containing the trained networks. The folders seed_numbers_data and seed_numbers_test contain example images used for training and testing prior to augmentation of the data. Details of the project and how the training and testing sets were generated is given in the report Inference_write_up.pdf. The folder screenshots contains images of results including loss and accuracy graphs and confusion matrices.
